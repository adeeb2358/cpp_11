There's a separate directory with demo code for each major feature discussed
in the module. The demo code is organised into test suites built using a
test framework called Bandit. 

The Bandit files are included with the demo code. For more information, see
banditcpp.org.

You will get some warnings when building the demo code. As the purpose of the
code is to demonstrate various features, there are a lot of unused variables 
and so on. Building the code is primarily useful to check that the various
C++11 examples do indeed compile.

There are various examples of ill-formed code included in the demo files. 
They are disabled with #if COMPILE_ERROR directives. If you'd like to see
what happens when you try to compile ill-formed code, change 
#define COMPILE_ERROR from 0 to 1.

Linux/MacOS X
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the test code, you'll need to have GCC 4.8.1 installed and have g++
available in the PATH.

Simply run make to build the demo code. There may be multiple executables 
built, they will all be prefixed with run-. 

Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the test code, you'll need to have MinGW GCC 4.8.1 installed and 
have g++ available in the PATH.

Simply run make.bat to build the demo code. There may be multiple executables 
built, they will all be prefixed with run-.
